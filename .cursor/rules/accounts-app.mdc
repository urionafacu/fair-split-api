# Accounts App Guide

The [accounts/](mdc:accounts) app manages user authentication, user models, and related logic:

- The custom user model is defined in [models/user.py](mdc:accounts/models/user.py), using Django's AbstractBaseUser and RulesModelMixin for permissions.
- User management logic is handled by a custom manager in [managers.py](mdc:accounts/managers.py).
- API serialization for users is in [serializers.py](mdc:accounts/serializers.py), with separate serializers for reading and writing user data.
- Authentication endpoints (login, logout) are implemented in [views.py](mdc:accounts/views.py).
- REST API viewsets for user operations are in [viewsets.py](mdc:accounts/viewsets.py).
- App-specific permissions and rules are in [rules.py](mdc:accounts/rules.py).
- URL routing for the app is in [urls.py](mdc:accounts/urls.py).
- Tests for user functionality are in [tests/](mdc:accounts/tests) and [tests.py](mdc:accounts/tests.py).

This app is registered in the project settings and is referenced as the AUTH_USER_MODEL.
