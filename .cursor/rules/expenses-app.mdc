# Expenses App Guide

The [expenses/](mdc:expenses) app manages expense groups, group members, and expenses:

- The [models/](mdc:expenses/models) directory contains:
  - [group.py](mdc:expenses/models/group.py): Defines the Group and GroupMember models for organizing users and their roles in groups.
  - [expense.py](mdc:expenses/models/expense.py): Defines the Expense model, linked to groups.
- API serialization for expenses, groups, and group members is in [serializers.py](mdc:expenses/serializers.py).
- REST API viewsets for expenses and groups are in [viewsets.py](mdc:expenses/viewsets.py), using custom mixins for read/write serializers.
- URL routing for the app is in [urls.py](mdc:expenses/urls.py).
- Tests for expense functionality are in [tests.py](mdc:expenses/tests.py).
- Database migrations are in [migrations/](mdc:expenses/migrations).

This app is registered in the project settings and is integrated with the accounts app for user-group relationships.
