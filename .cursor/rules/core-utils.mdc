# Core Utils Guide

The [core/utils/](mdc:core/utils) directory contains shared utility code for the project:

- [mixins.py](mdc:core/utils/mixins.py): Provides the ReadWriteSerializerMixin, which allows viewsets to use different serializers for read and write operations based on the request method or action.

This directory is intended for reusable logic that can be shared across multiple apps.
